\subsection{This is not really science}

Although this article is written in a pseudo-formal and quasi-rigorous
style, my inquiry is neither formal nor rigorous. I engaged in this
uncontrolled experiment for fun. Any resemblance to between this article
and a rigorous work of scientific inquiry is purely a choice of style.

\subsection{The author is no expert}

I am not an expert on collaboration. In fact, I have very little
experience in it. I simply made a clear choice to consciously participate
in it.
